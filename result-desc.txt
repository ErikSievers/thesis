out1 and 2 are from the old system that's probably broken.
out3 tests cutting objects 13 times
out4 tests cutting objects 6 times
out5 tests cutting objects 26 times
out6 is same as out5 except that it uses density=true on histogram creation

Completely unsurprising, the more time the object is cut the harder predictions become.
