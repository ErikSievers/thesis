out1 and 2 are from the old system that's probably broken.
out3 tests cutting objects 13 times
out4 tests cutting objects 6 times
out5 tests cutting objects 26 times
out6 is same as out5 except that it uses density=true on histogram creation
out7 is using the new mask and includes spatstat

----
out8 is the first time using cross validation
out9 is same as out8, but with less oversampling
out10 is same as out8, but with more oversampling

Completely unsurprising, the more time the object is cut the harder predictions become.
